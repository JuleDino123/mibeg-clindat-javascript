# JavaScript Playground

The `main` branch of this repository can be started up as a codespace. It includes all the necessary tools for our JavaScript training: The JavaScript runtime Node, its package manager `npm`, and a database instance (MongoDB) ready to connect to.

## Installation

Node dependencies (Express, Mongoose, Nodemon) are installed automatically on start-up via `postCreateCommand` in the `devcontainer.json` file.

You can always install them manually with `npm install`.

## Run Your Code

- Run your code in `main.ja` as a command-line application with `node main.js`, or
- Run the Express server with `npm start`.
